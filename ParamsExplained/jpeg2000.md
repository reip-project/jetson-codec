## codec usage

JPEG 2000(JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system.
It could be adapted for motion imaging video compression with the motion jpeg 2000 extensions(which is mjpeg in ffmpeg i believe, not this one jpeg2000).


if you apply this codec to a video, it will transform frame by frame, which is extremely slow and not recommended.
